        <p className={styles.sectionText}>
          AccureCFO provides online bookkeeping, maintenance of financial records, 
          reconciliation, and reporting. We may also offer optional assistance, such 
          as catch-up bookkeeping, financial reports, and accounting software

          detailed in a written agreement or subscription plan between the Client

        <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>3. Client Responsibilities</h2>
        <p className={styles.sectionText}>
          Customers are required to give accurate information, such as bank 
          statements, invoices, receipts, and any other financial documents needed 
          to conduct bookkeeping services. AccureCFO is not accountable for any 
          errors that may have been caused by incomplete or inaccurate data 
          received from the customer. Customers are accountable for checking reports 
          and reporting any discrepancies within a sufficient period.
        </p>

        <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>4. Payment and Billing</h2>
        <p className={styles.sectionText}>
          All payments are due according to the payment plan or invoice. Payment 
          terms and conditions will be published in writing. Failure to make a 
          timely payment might trigger suspension of services until such time as 
          payment is received in full. All fees are non-refundable except as 
          otherwise specified in writing. Prices will be updated from time to 
          time, and notice will be given before any change.
        </p>

        <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>5. Confidentiality</h2>
        <p className={styles.sectionText}>
          AccureCFO is committed to maintaining clients' confidentiality in respect 
          of all business and financial information. We will not disclose, sell, or 
          transfer client information to any third party except as required to 
          deliver services, for compliance with law, or with written permission from 
          the client beforehand. All employees and subcontractors of AccureCFO have 
          strict confidentiality obligations.
        </p>

        <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p className={styles.sectionText}>
          AccureCFO aims to provide accurate and reliable services; nevertheless, we 
          cannot ensure that our services are free from errors or interruptions. To 
          the extent permitted under applicable law, AccureCFO will be held liable 
          for any loss, damages, or costs that may directly or indirectly result 
          from the use of our services, including but not limited to business 
          disruption, loss of profits, or loss of data.

        <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>7. Termination of Services</h2>
        <p className={styles.sectionText}>
          Either party can bring the agreement to an end by serving written notice, 
          subject to any notice period agreed. On termination, the client shall pay 
          all sums then due. AccureCFO will deliver all completed bookkeeping 
          records up to the date of termination. No future obligations shall remain 
          thereafter except as otherwise agreed.

        <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p className={styles.sectionText}>
          We begin the process by collecting your information, including business 
          details, to design a finance strategy. Afterwards, our experts prepare 
          financial reports to boost clarity in your business's accounts.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.sectionText}>
          We prioritize our clients' decisions and disclose required information to 
          third parties only if they consent. All data comply with legal obligations 
          and conditions. While this process is ongoing, you have the right to 
          restrict any service or request an audit.
        </p>

        <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p className={styles.sectionText}>
          AccureCFO honors your privacy and makes every sensible effort to protect 
          your financial and personal information. This Privacy Policy details how 
          we gather, use, store, and protect information gathered via our website, 
          products, and communications.
        </p>

        <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>2. Information We Gather</h2>
        <p className={styles.sectionText}>
          To perform accounting services, we can gather business and personal 
          information including your name, email address, business name, contact 
          details, payment information, and accounting records. Non-identifiable 
          data such as IP address, device, and browser type can also be collected 
          to improve our web analysis.
        </p>

        <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>3. Your Data Usage</h2>
        <p className={styles.sectionText}>
          Your data is used only to offer and improve our services. It includes 
          creating financial reports, processing bookkeeping tasks, invoicing, 
          contact with you about your account, and customer care. Within or for 
          service enhancements, anonymous data can be applied.
        </p>

        <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>4. Data Security and Storage</h2>
        <p className={styles.sectionText}>
          Encrypted servers with restricted access store all client information 
          safely. We use internal access restrictions, SSL encryption, and secure 
          passwords among other strong security measures. Although we take all 
          practical safeguards, no digital system is completely immune to 
          intrusions; hence, we cannot assure total data security.
        </p>

        <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>5. Sharing of Knowledge</h2>
        <p className={styles.sectionText}>
          AccureCFO does not lease, sell, or trade customer information. Only as 
          needed to provide our services will we give reputable outside providers 
          (e.g., accounting software vendors or cloud storage providers) restricted 
          data. All outside parties have to follow strong data security and privacy 
          policies.
        </p>

        <h2 className={styles.sectionTitle}>6. Storing of Data</h2>
        <p className={styles.sectionText}>
          Your information is kept only as long as it takes to reach the objective 
          for which it was collected or as legally mandated. Depending on 
          legislative or regulatory standards, customers may ask for a refurbishment 
          or return of their data following service cancellation.
